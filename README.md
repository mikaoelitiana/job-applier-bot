# Job Applier

An AI agent that applies to jobs on your behalf. Send a job posting URL to a Telegram bot — the agent opens the page, reads the description, fills the application form, uploads your resume, submits, and logs the result to a Google Sheet.

## How it works

```
Telegram message (URL)
  → bot receives it
  → browser-use agent navigates to the URL
      → reads job description
      → finds the application form
      → fills all fields using your profile
      → uploads your resume PDF
      → submits the form
  → result is written to Google Sheets with all columns
  → bot replies with the outcome
```

**Stack:** [browser-use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use) · python-telegram-bot · gspread · Docker

## Supported LLM providers

The bot supports multiple LLM providers via the `LLM_MODEL` variable (format: `<provider>/<model-name>`):

| Provider | Example Model | Required API Key |
|----------|---------------|------------------|
| Anthropic | `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| OpenAI | `openai/gpt-4o` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| Google Gemini | `gemini/gemini-2.0-flash` | `GEMINI_API_KEY` |
| Perplexity | `perplexity/sonar-pro` | `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` |
| OpenRouter | `openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp` | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` |
| Ollama Cloud | `ollamacloud/llama3.3:70b` | `OLLAMACLOUD_API_KEY` |
| MiniMax | `minimax/MiniMax-M2.5` | `MINIMAX_API_KEY` |
| OpenCode Zen | `opencode/claude-sonnet-4-5` | `OPENCODE_API_KEY` |
| Together AI | `together/meta-llama/Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct-FP8` | `TOGETHER_API_KEY` |
| Ollama (local) | `ollama/llama3` | (none) |

You can also set a fallback model with `FALLBACK_LLM_MODEL` — used when the primary model returns invalid output.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your VPS (or local machine)
- An Anthropic (or OpenAI / Gemini / Perplexity / OpenRouter / Ollama / MiniMax / OpenCode / Together) API key
- A Telegram bot token
- A Google Sheet with columns: `Company`, `Title`, `Status`, `Job Posting Link`, `Contact`, `Application Date`, `Interview Stage`, `Interviewer`, `Notes`
- A Google Cloud service account with Sheets access

---

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repo and create your `.env`

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd applier
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and fill in all required values (see comments in the file).

### 2. Add your assets

The bot needs your resume and profile to fill application forms. You can provide them in two ways:

**Option A — Upload via Telegram (easiest)**

Once the bot is running, simply send the files directly in the chat:

- Send a **PDF file** → saved as your resume
- Send a **JSON file** → saved as your profile

**Option B — Place files manually**

Put your files in the `assets/` directory before starting the bot:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `assets/resume.pdf` | Your resume — uploaded to application forms |
| `assets/profile.json` | Your personal details used to fill forms |
| `assets/service_account.json` | Google service account key (optional — see step 4) |

Edit `assets/profile.json` with your real information. The template is pre-filled with placeholders.

> **Note:** `service_account.json` is only required if you use the file-based credential option (Option B in step 4). If you set `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` in `.env`, you don't need this file at all.

### 3. Create a Telegram bot

1. Open Telegram and message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
2. Send `/newbot` and follow the prompts
3. Copy the token it gives you into `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` in your `.env`
4. Find your own Telegram user ID by messaging [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot)
5. Add your user ID to `ALLOWED_TELEGRAM_USER_IDS` in `.env` to restrict access to yourself

### 4. Set up Google Sheets access (service account)

A service account lets the bot write to your sheet without any OAuth browser flow — ideal for a headless VPS.

**Step 1 — Create a Google Cloud project**

1. Go to [https://console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Create a new project (or reuse an existing one)

**Step 2 — Enable the Google Sheets API**

1. In your project, go to **APIs & Services → Library**
2. Search for "Google Sheets API" and click **Enable**

**Step 3 — Create a service account**

1. Go to **APIs & Services → Credentials**
2. Click **Create Credentials → Service Account**
3. Give it any name (e.g. `job-applier`)
4. Skip the optional role/user steps and click **Done**

**Step 4 — Download the JSON key**

1. Click the service account you just created
2. Go to the **Keys** tab
3. Click **Add Key → Create new key → JSON**
4. The file downloads automatically to your computer

**Step 5 — Configure credentials**

You have two options for providing the key to the bot:

**Option A — Env var (recommended for VPS/CI)**

Minify the downloaded JSON to a single line and set it in `.env`:

```bash
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON={"type":"service_account","project_id":"..."}
```

A quick way to minify it:
```bash
cat ~/Downloads/your-key-file.json | python3 -m json.tool --compact
```

**Option B — File mount**

Save the downloaded file as `assets/service_account.json`. Leave `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` unset and the bot will fall back to reading the file via `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE` (defaults to `assets/service_account.json`).

**Step 6 — Share your Google Sheet with the service account**

1. Open your Google Sheet
2. Click **Share**
3. Add the service account's email address (visible in the Credentials page — it looks like `job-applier@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com`)
4. Give it **Editor** access
5. Click **Send**

**Step 7 — Copy the Sheet ID**

From your sheet's URL:
```
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/THIS_IS_THE_SHEET_ID/edit
```
Paste this value into `GOOGLE_SHEET_ID` in your `.env`.

**Step 8 — Ensure your sheet has the correct header row**

The first row of your target tab must include these columns (the bot will create them automatically if the sheet is empty):
```
Company | Title | Status | Job Posting Link | Contact | Application Date | Interview Stage | Interviewer | Notes
```

The default tab name is `Applications` — configure it via `GOOGLE_SHEET_TAB` in `.env`.

## Deployment

### Run with Docker Compose (recommended)

```bash
# Build and start
docker compose up -d

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Stop
docker compose down
```

Assets are stored in a named Docker volume (`applier_assets`) that persists across deployments and container restarts. You need to populate it once after the first deployment.

### Uploading assets to the volume

**Recommended — send files via Telegram**

Once the container is running, send your files directly to the bot in Telegram:

- Send a **PDF file** → saved as your resume
- Send a **JSON file** → saved as your profile

The bot confirms each upload and the files are stored in the persistent `applier_assets` volume immediately.

**Alternative — copy files with docker cp**

If you prefer to copy files from outside the container:

```bash
# Upload from your local machine to the VPS first
scp assets/resume.pdf assets/profile.json user@your-vps-ip:/tmp/

# Then copy from the VPS into the running container
docker cp /tmp/resume.pdf applier:/app/assets/resume.pdf
docker cp /tmp/profile.json applier:/app/assets/profile.json
```

The container must be running before `docker cp` will work (the volume is created on first start).

If you set `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` as an env var, you don't need to copy `service_account.json`.

Files survive redeployments — repeat whichever method you prefer whenever you want to update your resume or profile.

### Run locally (without Docker)

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install chromium
playwright install-deps chromium

cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env, then:
python -m src.bot
```

---

## Usage

### Upload your resume and profile

Send files directly to the bot to update your assets at any time:

- Send a **PDF** → replaces your resume (`assets/resume.pdf`)
- Send a **JSON** → replaces your profile (`assets/profile.json`)

The bot validates the JSON before saving and confirms each upload.

### Apply to a job

Send a job posting URL:

```
Application submitted!

Job: Senior Software Engineer
Company: Example Corp

Logged to Google Sheet.
```

Or if something went wrong:

```
Application failed.

Job: Senior Software Engineer
Company: Example Corp
Reason: Form requires login — no public application available.

Logged to Google Sheet.
```

## Security notes

- `assets/resume.pdf` contains personal data — never commit it to git
- `assets/service_account.json` contains sensitive credentials — never commit it to git (prefer the `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` env var on a VPS so no file needs to be transferred)
- Use `ALLOWED_TELEGRAM_USER_IDS` to restrict bot access to your own account
- Keep your `.env` file out of version control (it is in `.gitignore`)
